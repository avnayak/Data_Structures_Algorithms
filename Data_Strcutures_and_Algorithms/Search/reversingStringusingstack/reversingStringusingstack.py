'''
 Reversing a Word.
 A stack is used to reverse the letters. First the characters are extracted one by one from
the input string and pushed onto the stack. Then theyâ€™re popped off the stack and displayed.
Because of its last-in-first-out characteristic, the stack reverses the order of the
characters.
